    <h1>RESULT</h1>
    <p>Leaders of tomorrow, bold and wise,  
See the world through clearer skies.  
They lead with purpose, hearts aglow,  
Guiding the way for seeds to grow.  

The future awaits with open doors,  
A chance to build, to break old floors.  
Where strength is measured by what we give,  
And leadership’s truth is how we live.  

In the future, we lead not just to reign,  
But to heal the wounds, to ease the pain.  
With compassion, vision, and steady hands,  
We craft a world where unity stands.  

The future of leadership is not a race,  
It’s a legacy of kindness, strength, and grace.  
And those who lead, with courage true,  
Will shape a world where hope renews.</p>
