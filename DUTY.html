    <h1>A DUTY OF A LEADER</h1>
    <p>A real leader stands with steady hand,  
Not for power, but to understand.  
Their heart, a compass, guiding true,  
For the many, not the few.     

They lead by action, not by talk,  
Through every challenge, they will walk.  
A true leader bears the weight with grace,  
Ensuring hope in every place.  

Their duty’s not to seek their gain,  
But to ease others’ hurt and pain.  
For a real leader’s soul is clear,  
Their responsibility, sincere.  

Through sacrifice, they’ll give their best,  
Not seeking rest, but seeking quest.  
For true leadership is not about the crown,  
It’s lifting others, never putting them down.</p>
