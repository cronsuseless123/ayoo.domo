    <h1>A LEADER'S VOICE</h1>
    <p>Words are more than sound and tone,  
They carve the path, they build the throne.  
Each syllable a choice to make,  
A spark that leads the hearts to wake.  

In silence, power can retreat,  
But spoken words can make hearts beat.  
A leader speaks not just to guide,  
But to empower, stand, and stride.  

The weight of speech is heavy, true,  
It shapes the world, both old and new.  
So speak with purpose, speak with care,  
For in your words, the future’s there.  

A leader’s voice can heal, can sway,  
It can lead the lost or light the way.  
So when the moment comes to speak,  
Speak with wisdom, firm, unique.</p>
